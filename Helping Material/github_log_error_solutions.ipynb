    "# Most Common Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like you're facing a situation where your local branch `main` has diverged from the remote branch `main`. This can happen when there are conflicting changes made to the same lines of code in both branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, you have a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Merge**:\n",
    "   Run `git pull --tags origin main --no-rebase` to merge the remote changes into your local branch. This option will create a merge commit, which combines the histories of both branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rebase**:\n",
    "   Run `git pull --tags origin main --rebase` to rebase your changes on top of the remote changes. This option replays your local commits on top of the updated history from the remote branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fast-forward only**:\n",
    "   Run `git pull --tags origin main --ff-only` if you want to perform a fast-forward merge only. This option will only apply if your local branch's history is a direct descendant of the remote branch's history, without any divergent commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the option that best fits your workflow and project requirements. If you're unsure, merging is often the simplest approach for resolving divergent branches."
