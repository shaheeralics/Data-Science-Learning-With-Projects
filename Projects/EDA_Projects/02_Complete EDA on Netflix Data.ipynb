The goal of this project is to provide insights and understanding about the dataset, which can be useful for various purposes such as content recommendation, trend analysis, and business strategy.\n","\n","The purpose of this notebook is to guide you through the EDA process and help you practice your data analysis skills. By exploring and analyzing this dataset, you can learn how to extract valuable information, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions. This project is important for someone to read as it can serve as a reference for conducting EDA on similar datasets, and it can also help you improve your data analysis and problem-solving abilities.\n","\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","\n","**Questions to be Answered:**\n","\n","\n","\n","**`Question No 01:`** What is the distribution of the \"type\" column (movie vs. TV show) over the years?\n","\n","**`Question No 02:`** Which countries have the most content available on Netflix, and how has this changed over time?\n","\n","**`Question No 03:`** What are the most common genres or \"listed_in\" categories for movies and TV shows, and how do they differ?\n","\n","**`Question No 04:`** How has the average duration of movies and TV shows changed over the years?\n","\n","**`Question No 05:`** Which directors or actors have the most titles in the dataset, and are there any trends or patterns in their content?\n","\n","**`Question No 06:`** Are there any relationships between the rating, duration, and genre of the Netflix titles?\n","\n","**`Question No 07:`** How does the distribution of release years differ between movies and TV shows?\n","\n","**`Question No 08:`** Can you identify any seasonal or monthly patterns in the release of new content on Netflix?\n","\n","**`Question No 09:`** Are there any notable differences in the distribution of titles between the \"Documentaries\", \"Dramas\", and \"Comedies\" genres?\n","\n","**`Question No 10:`** Can you find any significant correlations between the variables in the dataset, and how might these insights be useful for content recommendation or marketing strategies?\n","\n","<p>&nbsp</p>\n","\n","**Assumptions:** \n","\n","- The dataset is complete and accurate, with no major missing data or errors.\n","- The date_added column accurately represents when the title was added to Netflix.\n","- The metadata (director, cast, country, etc.) is reliable and up-to-date.\n","  \n","**Methodology:**\n","\n","- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (handle missing values, convert data types, etc.)\n","- Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.\n","- Explore the data using visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, bar charts) to identify patterns and trends.\n","- Perform statistical analysis (e.g., correlation, regression) to uncover deeper insights.\n","- Document the findings and insights in a clear and organized manner.\n","\n","**Scope:**\n","\n","- This project will focus on analyzing the Netflix titles dataset and providing insights that can be useful for content providers, subscribers, and researchers.\n","- The analysis will be limited to the information available in the provided dataset and will not include any external data sources.\n","- The goal is to practice EDA skills and provide a comprehensive understanding of the Netflix content landscape.\n","\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","\n","## **1.2 Data Description**\n","\n","**Content:** \n","\n","This dataset is a CSV
