        "This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset \"netflix_titles.csv\" which contains information about various movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform. The goal of this project is to provide insights and understanding about the dataset, which can be useful for various purposes such as content recommendation, trend analysis, and business strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this notebook is to guide you through the EDA process and help you practice your data analysis skills. By exploring and analyzing this dataset, you can learn how to extract valuable information, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions. This project is important for someone to read as it can serve as a reference for conducting EDA on similar datasets, and it can also help you improve your data analysis and problem-solving abilities.\n",
