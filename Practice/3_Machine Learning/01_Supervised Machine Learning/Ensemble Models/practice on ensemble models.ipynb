    "## **Wine Quality Prediction: Vinho Verde Wine Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets provided contain samples of red and white Vinho Verde wines from the northern region of Portugal. The objective is to model wine quality based on physicochemical properties, as detailed in [Cortez et al., 2009] (see http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/).\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets represent red and white variants of Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. For additional information, refer to http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the study by Cortez et al., 2009. Due to privacy and logistical constraints, the datasets include only physicochemical (input) variables and sensory (output) data, such as wine quality scores. There is no information on grape types, wine brands, or selling prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be approached as either classification or regression tasks, with the classes being ordered but unbalanced (e.g., there are significantly more average wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection techniques could be employed to identify the few instances of exceptional or substandard wines. Furthermore, the relevance of all input variables is not guaranteed, suggesting that feature selection methods could be valuable for identifying the most important factors.\n",
